Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic: 
Utilize kNN to flag potential anomalies in network data and 
develop a more robust model by applying an MLP optimized with SGD to detect subtle anomalies.


High-level workflow:
    Data Collection & Preprocessing
    kNN-based anomaly scoring
    MLP training with combined features (original features + kNN-based anomaly signals)
    Final anomaly predictions
